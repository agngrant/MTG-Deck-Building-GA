# MTG-Deck-Building-GA
My Nuffield Future Researcher Project

I am going to use MTG Forge to play ai vs ai matches in the terminal and assign each card a Fitness score based on their total wins and losses.

In order to run the parts of this program yourself you should have Forge installed, and edit the code to list the directories where your decks, Forge files, etc are stored.

Update: At the end I will include a text file which you can write the directory data in.

As of 21:32, 21/08/20, the code has been mostly completed, I am just troubleshooting some minor errors with MTG Forge and the mutation. It works for one cycle. 
If you are trying to run the code on your pc make sure there are no programs in the background using javaw.exe, since this will make the fitness function loop until that program has finished.
